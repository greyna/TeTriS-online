TeTriS Online
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project launched by greyna in december, 2011.

This usual tetris is a project made to learn HTML5, JavaScript, API canvas and finally AJAX which need a server installation.
It is open for any modification, advice or anything, anyway it is made as an exercise.

The game's philosophy is to let the player "make his own game".
He would be able to create maps, define new pieces, adjust the velocity function of the score then publish it to the server.
A ranking of each game played on each map would be the last optimization, with an user profile system, and maybe a forum.
